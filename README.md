## About This Config

I use NeoVim for the little edits I need to do fast without having to use an IDE or a big code editor, one of its amazing pros is it's customizable with a programming language which is [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).  
This is my config files made in lua saved here so I can get it when ever I change my device.

In this config [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used as the plugin manager for all plugins.

I don't use ton of pluggins with NeoVim, I just use the pluggins that I find helpful with the little fast tasks I do with NeoVim; so you'll find this config minimal in compare of other configs for NeoVim.
