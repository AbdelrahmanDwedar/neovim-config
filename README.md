## About This Configuration

I use NeoVim for the little edits I need to do fast without having to use an IDE or a big code editor, one of its amazing pros is it's customizable with a programming language which is [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).  
This is my configuration files made in Lua saved here so I can get it when ever I change my device.

In this config [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) is used as the plugin manager for all plugins.

I don't use ton of plugins with NeoVim, I just use the plugins that I find helpful with the little fast tasks I do with NeoVim; so you'll find this config minimal in compare of other configs for NeoVim.
